This quote indicates that the model requires additional measurements to determine the parameters β and γ, which describe the capacity recovery effect.


""The voltage is also not predicted correctly at instances where the battery starts charging after a period where the battery was not being used (i.e. at +/-150 minutes). This occurs because there is a difference between the open circuit potential OCP that is measured when the battery is not used, and the charging voltage that is being measured when the battery is charged. The model does not (yet) account for this difference.""

This quote suggests that the model does not accurately predict the battery voltage when the battery starts charging after a period of non-use, due to a difference between the open-circuit potential and the charging voltage.


""However the main purpose of the proposed model is not to give an accurate prediction of the battery voltage over time, but to give an accurate prediction of the SoC over time.""

This quote indicates that the model is primarily focused on predicting the battery SoC, rather than the battery voltage.

""Finally, the battery dynamics is influenced by aging upon repeated usage. To consider the effect of battery aging, we proposed to update the network parameters regularly. Based on our experience, a two-month or even longer gap is acceptable as the battery aging process is slow.""
This suggests that the proposed network may need to be updated periodically to account for battery aging over time.

""To capture the effects of ambient temperature, in this section, the proposed network is trained to learn the battery dynamics under varying temperatures.""
This indicates that the paper only evaluated the network's performance under varying temperatures, but did not explore other environmental factors that could impact battery state-of-charge, such as humidity or vibration.

""Data collected from a new combined DFU profile were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed network on SOC estimation.""

""To further improve this prediction model, this model can be tested on actual battery data from SSD once its available, and if possible, on actual usage data of LiFePO4.""
This suggests that the model was not tested on the actual SSD battery data, and that testing on LiFePO4 battery data would be beneficial to further improve the model.

""The battery current (Fig. 1a), voltage (Fig. 1b) and temperature (Fig. 1c) are given as input train data and the battery SOC (Fig. 1d) as input train label to the SVM model.""

The paper clearly states that the primary outcome measured is the state of charge (SOC) of lithium-ion batteries for UAVs, and the study uses support vector regression (SVR) to develop a model to estimate this SOC.

The paper acknowledges that the SOC estimation method has higher accuracy during discharge compared to the charging process, especially the transition from constant current (CC) to constant voltage (CV) charging.

""Therefore, in the future, when using SVR to set up a precise SOC model, we will focus on the charging process, especially the part of the accuracy of SOC prediction in CC steering and CV.""
The paper suggests that future research should focus on improving the accuracy of SOC prediction during the charging process, particularly the transition from CC to CV charging.

""Moreover, the data-set used in this paper contains a lot of battery charging and discharging data, so it can also be used in the estimation of remained useful life (RUL) [3,[16][17][18].""
The paper notes that the dataset used in this study could also be leveraged to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the batteries, in addition to SOC estimation.

""During the actual operation of UAV, there will be more external factors affecting the remaining battery capacity. For example, variable current discharge caused by variable speed flight, different environmental flight causes battery temperature changes and other external factors.

The paper acknowledges that the study only used static battery charging and discharging data, and that in actual UAV operation, there are more external factors (e.g., variable current discharge, temperature changes) that could affect battery capacity. The paper suggests that collecting data in more diverse environments could lead to more accurate SOC and RUL models.

""Additionally, when SVR is used to train data, the training time is longer. Therefore, future research can also be carried out to reduce the training time of model.""
The paper notes that the SVR training process can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, and suggests that future research could focus on reducing the training time of the model.
